# -Air-Pollution-Indicator-Web-App
Project Details:
Overview: EcoView is a web-based application that allows users to check the air quality at any location using latitude and longitude coordinates. It provides real-time data on various air pollutants and suggests eco-friendly actions like planting trees or using air purifiers based on the Air Quality Index (AQI).

Key Features:

Fetches real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Displays concentrations of major pollutants (e.g., CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10, NH₃).
Provides status-based environmental suggestions (e.g., how many trees or purifiers are needed).
Auto-detects user's location or allows manual input of coordinates.
Clean and modern UI using HTML, CSS (with gradient and responsive design), and JavaScript.
Includes a simulation link for a gas detection sensor built with Tinkercad.

Technologies Used:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API
Geolocation API
Tinkercad (for external sensor simulation)
